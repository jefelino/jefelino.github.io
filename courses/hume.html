<h1>
<em>Reading notes for PHIL 258 (JSR).</em>
</h1>
<p>
  In this passage from 1748, Hume argues that it is never rational to believe that a miracle occurred based on the testimony of human witnesses. He wrote this argument before the modern theory of probability and evidence was well-understood, and as a result some of the things he says do not exactly fit with it. As you are reading, think about how you might restate Hume's argument in terms of probability, evidence, and updating. 
  According to Hume, what evidence is relevant to miracles? What kind of strength factor does it have, and why? You should also think about whether you agree with Hume's assumptions along the way, and why.
</p>
<p>
  Apologies for Hume's sexist language.

    <h3>OF MIRACLES.</h3>
    <h4>PART I.</h4>
    <p>&hellip;</p>
    <p>Nothing is so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind, which must at least
    <i>silence</i> the most arrogant bigotry and superstition, and free us from their
    impertinent solicitations. I flatter myself, that <b>I have discovered an argument of a
        like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check
        to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as
        the world endures.</b> For so long, I presume, will the accounts of miracles and
    prodigies be found in all history, sacred and profane.</p>
    <p><span class="mnumtag"><span class="mnum"><a id="mnum87"
    name="mnum87">87.</a></span></span> Though experience be our only guide in reasoning
    concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not
    altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. One, who in
    our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of
    December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain, that
    he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken. However, we may observe, that,
    in such a case, he would have no cause to complain of experience; because it commonly
    informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by that contrariety of events, which we may
    learn from a diligent observation. All effects follow not with like certainty from
    their supposed causes. Some events are found, in all countries and all ages, to have
    been constantly conjoined together: Others are found to have been more variable, and
    sometimes to disappoint our expectations; so that, in our reasonings concerning
    matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest
    certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.</p>
    <p><b>A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence.</b> In such conclusions
    as are founded on an infallible experience, he expects the event with the last degree
    of assurance, and regards his past experience as a full <i>proof</i> of the future
    existence of that event. In other cases, he proceeds with more caution: He weighs the
    opposite experiments: He considers which side is supported by the greater number of
    experiments: to that side he inclines, with doubt and hesitation; and when at last he
    fixes his judgement, the evidence exceeds not what we properly call
    <i>probability</i>. All probability, then, supposes an opposition of experiments and
    observations, where the one side is found to overbalance the other, and to produce a
    degree of evidence, proportioned to the superiority. A hundred instances or
    experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any
    event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory,
    reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance
    the opposite experiments, where they are opposite, and deduct the smaller number from
    the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.</p>
    <p><span class="mnumtag"><span class="mnum"><a id="mnum88"
    name="mnum88">88.</a></span></span> To apply these principles to a particular
    instance; we may observe, that <b>there is no species of reasoning more common, more
        useful, and even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the
        testimony of men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators.</b> &hellip; It will be sufficient to observe that our assurance
    in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our observation
    of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the
    reports of witnesses. It being a general maxim, that no objects have any discoverable
    connexion together, and that all the inferences, which we can draw from one to
    another, are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular
    conjunction; it is evident, that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in
    favour of human testimony, whose connexion with any event seems, in itself, as little
    necessary as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree, had not
    men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were they not
    sensible to shame, when detected in a falsehood: Were not these, I say, discovered by
    experience to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we should never repose the
    least confidence in human testimony. A man delirious, or noted for falsehood and
    villany, has no manner of authority with us.</p>
    <p>And as the evidence, derived from witnesses and human testimony, is founded on
    past experience, so it varies with the experience, and is regarded either as a
    <i>proof</i> or a <i>probability</i>, according as the conjunction between any
    particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or
    variable. There are a number of circumstances to be taken into consideration in all
    judgements of this kind; and the ultimate standard, by which we determine all
    disputes, that may arise concerning them, is always derived from experience and
    observation. Where this experience is not entirely uniform on any side, it is
    attended with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgements, and with the same
    opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence. <b>We
        frequently hesitate concerning the reports of others. We balance the opposite
        circumstances, which cause any doubt or uncertainty; and when we discover a
        superiority on any side, we incline to it;</b> but still with a diminution of assurance,
    in proportion to the force of its antagonist.</p>
    <p><span class="mnumtag"><span class="mnum"><a id="mnum89"
    name="mnum89">89.</a></span></span> This contrariety of evidence, in the present
    case, may be derived from several different causes; from the opposition of contrary
    testimony; from the character or number of the witnesses; from the manner of their
    delivering their testimony; or from the union of all these circumstances. We
    entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact, when the witnesses contradict
    each other; when they are but few, or of a doubtful character; when they have an
    interest in what they affirm; when they deliver their testimony with hesitation, or
    on the contrary, with too violent asseverations. There are many other particulars of
    the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument, derived from
    human testimony.</p>
    <p><b>Suppose, for instance, that the fact, which the testimony endeavours to establish,
        partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous; in that case, the evidence,
        resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion
        as the fact is more or less unusual.</b> The reason why we place any credit in witnesses
    and historians, is not derived from any <i>connexion</i>, which we perceive <i>a
    priori</i>, between testimony and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a
    conformity between them. <b>But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom
        fallen under our observation, here is a contest of two opposite experiences; of which
    the one destroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the superior can only
    operate on the mind by the force, which remains. The very same principle of
        experience, which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of
        witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another degree of assurance against the fact,
        which they endeavour to establish; from which contradition there necessarily arises a
    counterpoize, and mutual destruction of belief and authority.</b></p>
    <p><i>I should not believe such a story were it told me by Cato</i>, was a proverbial
    saying in Rome, even during the lifetime of that philosophical patriot.
    The incredibility of a fact, it was allowed, might invalidate so great an
    authority.</p>
    <p>The Indian prince, who refused to believe the first relations concerning the
    effects of frost, reasoned justly; and it naturally required very strong testimony to
    engage his assent to facts, that arose from a state of nature, with which he was
    unacquainted, and which bore so little analogy to those events, of which he had had
    constant and uniform experience. Though they were not contrary to his experience,
    they were not conformable to it.</p>
    <p>&hellip;</p>
    <p><b>A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable
        experience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very
        nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be
        imagined.</b> Why is it more than probable, that all men must die; that lead cannot, of
    itself, remain suspended in the air; that fire consumes wood, and is extinguished by
    water; unless it be, that these events are found agreeable to the laws of nature, and
    there is required a violation of these laws, or in other words, a miracle to prevent
    them? <b>Nothing is esteemed a miracle, if it ever happen in the common course of
        nature.</b> It is no miracle that a man, seemingly in good health, should die on a
    sudden: because such a kind of death, though more unusual than any other, has yet
    been frequently observed to happen. But it is a miracle, that a dead man should come
    to life; because that has never been observed in any age or country. There must,
    therefore, be a uniform experience against every miraculous event, otherwise the
    event would not merit that appellation. And as a uniform experience amounts to a
    proof, there is here a direct and full <i>proof</i>, from the nature of the fact,
    against the existence of any miracle; nor can such a proof be destroyed, or the
    miracle rendered credible, but by an opposite proof, which is superior.</p>
    <p><span class="mnumtag"><span class="mnum"><a id="mnum91"
    name="mnum91">91.</a></span></span> <b>The plain consequence is (and it is a general
        maxim worthy of our attention), 'That no testimony is sufficient to establish a
        miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more
        miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish;</b> and even in that case
    there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an
    assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the
    inferior.' <b>When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I
        immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person
        should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should
        really have happened.</b> I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the
    superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater
    miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous, than the event
    which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or
    opinion.</p>
    <h4>PART II.</h4>
    &hellip;
    <p><span class="mnumtag"><span class="mnum"><a id="mnum93"
    name="mnum93">93.</a></span></span> <i>Secondly</i>. We may observe in human nature a
    principle which, if strictly examined, will be found to diminish extremely the
    assurance, which we might, from human testimony, have, in any kind of prodigy. The
    maxim, by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reasonings, is, that the
    objects, of which we have no experience, resembles those, of which we have; that what
    we have found to be most usual is always most probable; and that where there is an
    opposition of arguments, we ought to give the preference to such as are founded on
    the greatest number of past observations. But though, in proceeding by this rule, we
    readily reject any fact which is unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree; yet in
    advancing farther, <b>the mind observes not always the same rule; but when anything is
        affirmed utterly absurd and miraculous, it rather the more readily admits of such a
        fact, upon account of that very circumstance, which ought to destroy all its
        authority. The passion of <i>surprise</i> and <i>wonder</i>, arising from miracles,
        being an agreeable emotion, gives a sensible tendency towards the belief of those
        events, from which it is derived.</b> And this goes so far, that even those who cannot
    enjoy this pleasure immediately, nor can believe those miraculous events, of which
    they are informed, yet love to partake of the satisfaction at second-hand or by
    rebound, and place a pride and delight in exciting the admiration of others.</p>
    
    &hellip;

    <p>But suppose, that all the historians who treat of England, should agree, that, on
    the first of January 1600, Queen Elizabeth died; that both before and after her death
    she was seen by her physicians and the whole court, as is usual with persons of her
    rank; that her successor was acknowledged and proclaimed by the parliament; and that,
    after being interred a month, she again appeared, resumed the throne, and governed
    England for three years: I must confess that I should be surprised at the concurrence
    of so many odd circumstances, but should not have the least inclination to believe so
    miraculous an event. I should not doubt of her pretended death, and of those other
    public circumstances that followed it: I should only assert it to have been
    pretended, and that it neither was, nor possibly could be real. You would in vain
    object to me the difficulty, and almost impossibility of deceiving the world in an
    affair of such consequence; the wisdom and solid judgement of that renowned queen;
    with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artifice: <b>All
        this might astonish me; but I would still reply, that the knavery and folly of men
        are such common phenomena, that I should rather believe the most extraordinary events
        to arise from their concurrence, than admit of so signal a violation of the laws of
        nature.</b></p>
